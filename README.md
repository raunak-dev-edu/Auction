* An auction site where users can bid on the listed items after logging into the page.  
* Each listed items have the item's name, the image of the item, starting bid, the start time, the end time, and the option for bidding.  
* The bidding can only be placed between the start and end time.  
* Once the auction is complete, i.e., crossing end time, it shows the user (winner) who has quoted the highest amount.
